Not every packages is going to work every time, for every user, across every installation, with all data. The examples in this directory attempt to mitigate this for `replyr` by showing `replyr` in use with multiple data sources:

-   `data.frame`
-   `tbl`
-   `SQLite`
-   `MySQL`
-   `PostgreSQL`
-   Spark 1.6.2
-   Spark 2.0.0

Because a lot of the above systems depend on configuration and systems out of the R ecosystem we expect a lot of variation and a lot to go wrong. So the examples here also have a touch of "here it is working at least once" to them. Or put another way: these examples are the guarantee that new users are never the first to test common cases.
